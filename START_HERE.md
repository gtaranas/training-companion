## 💡 How It Works

```
You Enter Match → AI Predicts → You Record Result
                                     ↓
                            AI Learns & Improves
                                     ↓
                            Next Prediction Better!
```

The agent uses the **ACE Framework** to continuously learn from prediction outcomes without forgetting previous knowledge.
